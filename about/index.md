About Me


I am a second year Electronics and Communication Engineering student at Amrita University, Amritapuri Campus. Apart from academics, I have great interest in Free & Open Source Software. I have been contributing to FOSSASIA for a year now and have worked on the Phimpme Android Project as a part of my GSoC’17 project. I am currently working with the FOSSASIA community as a mentor for both the Codeheat and Google Code In. I am also contributing to the Phimpme Android project for its further development as a part of the FOSSASIA’s Advanced developer program.
