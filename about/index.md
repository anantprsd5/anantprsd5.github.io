I am a 1st year undergraduate student pursuing my degree in 
Computer Science Engineering from Amrita School of 
Engineering, Kerala, India. Apart from academics, I am 
avidly interested in contributing to Open Source software. 
Also, I am an active member of ​ FOSS@Amrita​  which is an Open 
Source club of my university. My special interest lies in 
developing for android and was really fascinated by the 
idea of taking part in Google Summer Of Code, so I went 
through some Android projects and found this project really 
interesting to work on. I have worked with firebase and 
have basic knowledge of integrating with RESTFUL Web 
services in android. Currently learning Aerogear libraries 
which are the main libraries used in this project. I have 
also done some contributions to the project and plan to do 
more. I am familiar with the code base of the project would 
like to work on it to make it even better. I am an ever 
learner and keen to learn and explore new technologies.
